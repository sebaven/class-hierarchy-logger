class-hierarchy-logger
======================

Helper classes to log the complete hierarchy of a class in Objective-C.


What can I do with this? What led you to implement it?
------------------------------------------------------

One of my apps uses several APIs, resulting in a complex hierarchy. I needed to migrate all the requests from one endpoint to a newer one, and this helper saved a lot of time. It might also be helpful to understand your UIView or UIViewController class hierarchy.

Have fun!
